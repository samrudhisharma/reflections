When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

There are times that the changes are quite small (not logical) in such a case clubbing these changes with the next logical change and then pulling the changes might be a better approach.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

We can compare the changes made by someone else/or previously with the current local changes.
